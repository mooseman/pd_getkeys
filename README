   ***  README -  pd_getkeys *** 

Just some code to read keys from the keyboard (especially those 
with multiple keys like arrow keys, function keys).

I plan to use this code in pd_readline to allow easy reading of the 
arrow keys for command-history recall and line-editing.    

As usual, all code in this repo is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy......."  :)
